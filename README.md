# Cloudi-Gen

`cloudi-gen` is a CLI tool that aids in the generation of cloud-init configurations, making it easier for you to set up cloud instances with your desired configurations.

## Features

1. **User Creation**: Easily create a user on your cloud instance with a specified username.
2. **SSH Key Import from GitHub**: Import SSH keys directly from a GitHub handle, streamlining the setup process.
3. **Package Installation**: Specify packages you want installed on your cloud instance right from the start.
4. **Fail2Ban Configuration**: Enhance security with `fail2ban`. By default, it's installed, but you have the option to disable it.
5. **SSH Configurations**: Customize SSH settings, including:
   - Allowing/Disallowing SSH TCP tunneling.
   - Allowing/Disallowing SSH X11 forwarding.
   - Allowing/Disallowing SSH agent forwarding.
6. **Pretty Print**: Get a neatly formatted output. By default, the output is machine-readable, but you can opt for a more human-friendly version.

## Usage Example

```bash
cloudi-gen -u jontze -g jontze -p curl -p jq > cloud-init.yml
```

With this commend:

- A user named `jontze` will be created on the cloud instance
- The SSH keys of the GitHub user `jontze` will be imported
- The packages `curl` and `jq` will be installed
- The cloud-init configuration will be saved to `cloud-init.yml`
